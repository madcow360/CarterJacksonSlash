 It is agreed upon that In regards to Hours that the equation
 \large
 \begin{align}
 \text{Hours} &= \frac{22(42\phi)+150\mu + 60\eta}{60}\\
 &= \frac{924}{60}\phi + \frac{150}{60}\mu + \frac{60}{60}\eta\\
 &= \frac{77}{5}\phi + \frac{5}{2}\mu + \eta\\\nonumber
  \text{where}\\ \nonumber
 \phi &=  \text{Number of Seasons Owed}\\\nonumber
 \mu &=  \text{Number of Movies Owed}\\\nonumber
 \eta &=  \text{Number of Extra Hours Owed}
